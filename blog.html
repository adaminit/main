    <p class="font-sans">For real talk, why is it that so many of "Furries" easily OSINT-able? Is it because they are socially awkward, spend most of their time online and make so many connections and breadcrumbs to trace back to them? I honestly don't know. Don't even get me started on how they claim to be a minority. The regular people ARE the minority. Most of the "fandom" are porn addicts, a smaller portion being groomers/pedophiles. Teenage furries are bound to be exploited or somehow lied to. I feel no remorse for pedophiles, at that point, all they have to provide is money. Take it from them. That brings us to government.. why are online "content creators" immune to the law? Does anyone report them? We end up with stuff like EDP445 not being reported, DrDisrespect (LOL) and Shane Dawson FUCKING HIS CAT</p>
